# Header Update Instructions

All pages should use the shared header component from `components/header.html`.

The mobile navigation has been updated to be clean and professional:
- No icons in navigation items
- Clean typography
- Professional spacing
- Consistent CTA button

To update other pages, replace their mobile nav sections with the structure from `components/header.html`.
